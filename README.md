# Individual Differences in Cross-modal Correspondences
By Hazel Anderson, Jonas Kristoffer Lindeløv, Thomas Alrik Sørensen, and Lihan Chen

## Experiment files
This experiment was run using [PsychoPy](http://psychopy.org/). The full experiment can be found in the **experiment** folder. Although we used a gamepad, it also supports keyboard input.

## Data

 * **data_pilot** was some pilot data that was available at the time of pre-registration. The analysis scripts were verified against this data.
 * **data exp 2018.11 rate** is the ratings on the explicit dimension matching task.
 * **data exp 2018.11 test** is the implicit association test.

Run the **.R** files in sequential order starting with **CMC_1...** and on. Each step saves an output which can be used by later steps. The outputs that were used for the results in the paper is included in this repo. Note that the RT inference takes around 12 hours to run on a reasonably powerful 4-core i7 laptop.

## Pre-registration
This study was pre-registered. The commit history shows adherence to this analysis plan. We described this analysis strategy in a second part of the pre-registration at [https://osf.io/9xqep/](https://osf.io/9xqep/).
