Individual Differences in Cross-modal Correspondences

You will need the following packags:

```r
install.packages("brms", "tidyverse", "parallel", "tidybayes", "readbulk", "BayesFM", "blavaan", "reshape2")
```

Then you can run the files in sequential order to go from raw data to the plots, figures, and tables in our paper. Note that the RT inference takes around 12 hours to run on a reasonably powerful 4-core i7 laptop.
