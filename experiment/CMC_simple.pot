msgid "In this block, you are going to see pairs of images which sometimes have accompanying sounds. There will be a pair of shapes on the left of the screen, and a pair of shapes on the right. All you need to do is decide which pairing feels correct to you. There will be a response bar at the bottom of the screen which ranges from strongly prefer the pairing on the left, to strongly prefer the pairing on the right, with no preference in the centre. If you feel the pair of images or images and sounds on the left of the screen is a better match, then indicate your preference to the left. If the pair of images or images and sounds on the right of the screen is a better match, then indicate your preference to the right. If you have no preference then choose that. Options between (slightly prefer and medium prefer) for either direction can also be made.  To make your choice, click on the response bar and a black triangle will appear there. If you want to change your selection, just click on a different point and the black triangle will move to there. To confirm your selection, click on the button on the bottom of the screen which lights up after making a choice."
